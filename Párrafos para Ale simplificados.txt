I sat up and looked around the room. 
We had a door-decorating contest for Halloween in the school. 
Each grade designed and decorated a door. 
The winning class had a pizza party on Halloween.

A crime has been committed at Freemont Street. 
The main suspect is a man, his name is Sean Baker. 
A man had been walking along the pathway and he was suddenly shot in the stomach. 
The suspect had brown hair, blue eyes and wore a baggy Armani suit just like Sean Baker's.

The sky was red and gold. 
I shrugged off my backpack fast so I could give my shoulders a break.
I lie back and looked to the whole sky.
