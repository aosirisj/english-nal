A crime has been committed at Freemont Street. The main suspect is a man named 
Sean Baker. It was said that a man had been walking along the pathway when he 
was suddenly shot in the stomach. The suspect had brown hair, blue eyes and wore 
a baggy Armani suit just like Sean Baker's.

They walked up the enormous stairway. Halfway up detective Sara noticed a 
weather vane through the window. She realized that the wind was blowing west and 
in order for it to have shut the door it would have to have been blowing east. 
Then Sara realized for the first time that there was a third set of footsteps on 
the stairs. Then it dawned on her and she realized she had walked into a trap.  


There is a man found dead in a circular mansion. The detective interviews the 
cook, maid, and babysitter. The cook said he couldn't have done it because he 
was preparing the meal. The maid said she couldn't have done it because she was 
dusting the corners. The babysitter said she couldn't because she was playing 
with the children. Who was lying?


A man walked in the house. He was about to hang up his coat when he heard his 
wife say, "No John! Don't do it!" There was a shot and the woman was dead. There 
was a police officer, a doctor, and a lawyer standing next to her. The woman's 
husband knew that the police officer did it.
